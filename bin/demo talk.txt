Welcome to VoxelVerse

VoxelVerse is a Steam Punk SandBox RPG unlike anything that has been created before. 
Think of it as a cross between minecraft, second life, and Skyrim.
Its a world where you can build, dig, or destroy anything you can imagine.
In this world you can change anything, and everything you change will be the same as you left it.

VoxelVerse is going to be a solar system made up of predominately user generated content.
But for the purpose of this demo I generated some resources like the islands, and the zeppelins to show what is possible.
but before we get started on the tour, I would like to spend a minute showing you a couple of features of my next generation voxel engine.

I loved building in minecraft,
but I was always frustrated that I only had one size block to build from and to created my own models I needed to hack the code.
I am not one to let things like that stop me, since I have been architecting and building virtual worlds for the last 12 years.
So for VoxelVerse I designed and built from scratch what I call an Oxel Engine. When you are done with the video, you can give it a try.

There are a number of new and unique things about voxelverse, the oxel engine, the independant Voxel models, and the crafting system.
First lets talk about the Oxel engine and how it allows you to build with a huge range of block sizes.
What this means is you can add an incredible amount detail to any object. 
Every pixel is editable, so lets walk up to this block and demonstrate.
To remove materials from the world you use your pick. 
To add materials you choose that material from the material quickbar.
Pretty standard so far. So you might notice and additional bar above the materials. 
This bar allows you choose the size of the material you wish to add or remove.
Lets start out placing a 4 meter block of rock. 
And we can surround it with a few more, build ourselves a strong home that we cant get out of.
So lets cut a doorway. The room is a bit small, lets open it up by cutting out some 2 meter blocks. 
Change block size to 2 meter, select the pick.
Now lets put in a doorway.
How about some side windows by that door.
Moving along, you see a flat wall ahead of me. I am going to cut a spherical depression in it. 
Now this shape could be a sphere, cylinder, triangle, a heart shape, or anything.
The power of oxel engine opens up a whole new realm of creating.

So we are going to move out to the Zeppelin for the next section.
So you have created this great shape, do you really want to do it over and over again?
Thats where the power of the Independant Voxel Models comes in.
Any shape you can create, you can create a Independant Voxel Model out of.
I don't have this exposed via the user interface yet. But I can show you the results.
We are going to add a cannon to the zeppelin. I will bring up the editor, and add a child model to the zeppelin.
Here is a cannon IVM I created based on the gun template. Any model created with the gun template can shoot.
So now my zeppelin has another cannon.
The Zeppelin its self it a IVM based on the ship template. So you can create your own ship, in what ever shape or configuration can imagine.
Just like the cannons, the engines on the ships are IVMs. And the engines and cannons are all crafted out of materials you find in the world.
So if you find better metals, you can make better pistons for your engine, or a better barrel for your gun. Or a faster better pick or sword.
Everything is buildable or craftable. What you build it out of makes a difference.

So now lets go up and fly the zeppelin, I look for the steering wheel, when I stand behind the steering wheel is asks me if I want to become captain.
when I choose yes, I now have the ablity to fly the zeppelin, and to shoot the cannons on the zeppelin.
Just like everything is buildable, everything is destructable. Lets head over to the enemy zeppelin and take a few shots.
Currently I can destroy this zeppelin, but in the future, if it loses enough of its balloon, it will start to sink.
If I destroy the engines, it will be stuck until they are repaired, if I take out the cannons, it will be powerless to fight back.

VoxelVerse will be a freemium browser based game that will be split into 3 phases.
Phase 1 is planned to be a massively single player game
Phase 2 will be massively multiplayer, this phase will add an arena where your fortress and ships can compete.
Phase 3 will be massively multiplayer, adding a real money auction house, and a focus on user generated quests and themes.
The gold you find while exploring is the same gold that will be used to purchase items from the shop. 
Gold is a way to accellerate your play, let you buy that rare mineral, rather then searching for it.
VoxelVerse needs your support and real money if possible on kickstarter to accellerate our progress.
If you cant afford to support VoxelVerse by donating, then support us by spreading the word! 
Tweet about us, post a link to our kickstarter project on a website, give someone a call.
To paraphrase Abraham Lincon. VoxelVerse shall be the birth of a new world, by the people, for the people!
