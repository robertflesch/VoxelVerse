Congratulations Captain. Use your mouse to turn the steering wheel, and click or drag the throttle on the left to go forward and back. This is a zeppelin, so it doesnt stop on a dime! 
Fly the zeppelin around, try using the cannon buttons on the right to shoot some things. Then dock the zeppelin or just jump off onto an island. Try digging, building, just remember your changes wont be saved.
