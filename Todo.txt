CRITICAL:
REENABLE: Saving on the network.
IMPROVE: Lava Flow should stop at X when flowing straight down? Break into rock emitter?
IMPROVE: Water Flow should stop at X when flowing straight down? Break into mist and then mist emitter?
TODO: Camera collision - ideally the camera will want to go back to its default distance and height, but collision with things around it can cause it to move closer to avatar at minimum, and ideally to move up and closers as needed


TODO: Backside of water oxels
TODO: Fix fire animation around wood so that it can work with any voxel. Is it a double voxel? Is there a limit to the amound of faces an oxel can have?
TODO: Head needs to turn up and down with camera.
TODO: Limit camera angle when in first person?


DRAGON
IMPROVE: Dragon: Needs idle animation, being stopped plays walk animation now
IMPROVE: Dragon: Needs walk animation
TODO:  Dragon: Dragon fire should only melt an oxel for a few turns, then it turns back solid. And when it flows, it doesnt leave anything behind.
FIX: Give each breath its own sound
FIX: When dragon hits something, it pops to the top of object
FIX: After landing goes back to flying too easy.
IMPROVE: Dragon: Starts going TOO fast when diving (really just moving forward).
IMPROVE: Pops between states (?) after landing
FIX: If you get on and off multiple times, the avatar angle gets off.


ZEPPELIN
TODO: Add new hud
TODO: Add ammo store and ammount
TODO: Add particles to cannon fire

CANNON
TODO - MINOR: Break the ammo description out into its own json file for reuse.

PARTICLE
TODO: All(Many) particles should share the same vertex manager, and maybe a modified rendering loop?

EMITTER
TODO: Create emitter manager and emitter class to use in showing splash, mist, fire, etc

WATER
FIX: Water not lighting correctly
FIX: Faces getting generated for when larger water oxel is next to smaller solid oxel
TODO: Water faces next to solid should be inverted, arg, how does this work with FIX above? have to split oxel?
ADJUST: Water speed.


LIGHTING - STATIC
FINISH: WORKING - directional component of lighting
FINISH: WORKING - per material attenuation
FIX: HOLD - Still bug in propogation by light enclousure
FIX: In ambient Occlusion - quads need to be flipped some times to show lighting correctly

LIGHTING - DYNAMIC
TODO: Add lighting manager for dynamic lights, so the closest X lights can be retrived

RENDERING
IMPROVE: When adjusting screen size, the dispose/create cycle is called multiple times. Should only re-get context when mouse is released.

////////////////////////////////////////////

IDEA: FOG
IDEA: How can I add voxel models as voxels? e.g. I torch is really voxel model, but it would be handy to have it as just a voxel(oxel). Solution: Add a model manager, that would add in torch models where ever the lights were.
IDEA: Low Prioity - Have clouds flow like a liquid
IDEA: Nice to be able to toggle autoflow
IDEA: Nice to be able to cancel flow and light tasks
IDEA: Great mini game, stop the water that is flowing into the town! Watch alexa trying to stop it was SO funny.
IDEA: Break out contour from flow, so any block can contour (like grass)
IDEA: Glass voxel are full bright
IDEA: on ambient occlusion, if neighbor is larger...
IDEA: on ambient occlusion, if neighbor is smaller...


////////////////////////////////////////////
COMPLETED
FIX: Dragon: Wings not right after taking off
FIX: Dragon Fire breath uses RED, yuck! Change to Lava or Fire
FIX: Lagging after hitting dragon breath on stone
FIX: Particles should be UNLIT, not lights
TODO: I notice a large frame rate hit the frame after I redraw a bunch of oxels, what give?
TYPEINFO: Add an fullbright flag to types.
FIX: Lights not spreading correctly
DONE: Lights below 1 meter dont work correctly
DONE: Arm on left with torch is annoying - clear view
DONE: Head voxel are annoying - clear view
DONE: Torch on and off!
FIX: Change the model for dragon breath so its not cannon
FIX: Torch attachment to hand doesnt dispose correctly
FIX: Dispose on torch attachment is cause exception
FIX: Mouse lock in full screen doesnt allow you to use GUI at all.
IMPROVE: She wants fullbright, any color
FIX - MINOR: Oxels appear to not already being removed. I just saw a oxel with no quads in addComponentData

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Goal: to become a profitable game studio in 1 year
SWOT:
Strengths:
14 years of experience designing and leading virtual worlds projects, leading successful software projects for 25 years.
Product in alpha stage so dev risk is lower
located in lower cost and area with tax breaks for game dev
licenseing opportunities
Designed from start to be mobile ready
Emerging market space.
Data driven design
Browser based
International market possibilities
Encourages user driven content

Weaknesses:
Single person studio
No connections to online publications
limited testing at scale
some dependancy on online service providers (player.io aka yahoo game network)

Opportunities
Minecraft exposed a 250 million opportunity which could be a billion dollar opportunity
steam punk space under targeted.

Threats
Adobe Flash is 5-10 years from end of lifecycle
While other next generation voxel engines exist. None are targeted toward this space currently.
