WORK

BOB NOTES:
FIX:Lava - flows forever now.
FIX:make smaller model for dragon breath

BJORN NOTES:
 *** Interactions.IOGet for LAVA no interaction defined
[11:56:18 AM] Bjorn: not sure , I had a pit of lava and a placed water so it flowed into lava, I wanted obsidian :P

ALEXA NOTES:
Avatar angle is wrong on dragon sometimes.

CRITICAL:
Dispose on torch attachment is cause exception
Mouse lock in full screen doesnt allow you to use GUI at all.
Lava Flow should stop at X when flowing straight down? Break into rock emitter?
Water Flow should stop at X when flowing straight down? Break into mist and then mist emitter?

IDEA: How can I add voxel models as voxels? e.g. I torch is really voxel model, but it would be handy to have it as just a voxel(oxel).
IDEA: Have clouds flow like a liquid

TODO: Backside of water oxels
TODO: Fix fire animation around wood so that it can work with any voxel. Is it a double voxel? Is there a limit to the amound of faces an oxel can have?
TODO: Head needs to turn up and down with camera.
TODO: Limit camera angle when in first person?


DRAGON
IMPROVE: Dragon: Needs idle animation, being stopped plays walk animation now
IMPROVE: Dragon: Needs walk animation
TODO:  Dragon: Dragon fire should only melt an oxel for a few turns, then it turns back solid. And when it flows, it doesnt leave anything behind.
FIX: Change the model for dragon breath so its not cannon
FIX: Give each breath its own sound
FIX: When dragon hits something, it pops to the top of object
FIX: After landing goes back to flying too easy.

AVATAR
FIX: Torch attachment to hand doesnt dispose correctly

ZEPPELIN
TODO: Add new hud
TODO: Add ammo store and ammount
TODO: Add particles to cannon fire

CANNON
TODO - MINOR: Break the ammo description out into its own json file for reuse.

PARTICLE
TODO: All(Many) particles should share the same vertex manager, and maybe a modified rendering loop?

EMITTER
Create emitter manager and emitter class to use in showing splash, mist, fire, etc

WATER
FIX: Water not lighting correctly
FIX: Faces getting generated for when larger water oxel is next to smaller solid oxel
TODO: Water faces next to solid should be inverted, arg, how does this work with FIX above? have to split oxel?

Dragon
IMPROVE: Dragon: Starts going TOO fast when diving (really just moving forward).
IMPROVE: Pops between states (?) after landing
FIX: If you get on and off multiple times, the avatar angle gets off.

LIGHTING - STATIC
FINISH: directional component of lighting
FINISH: per material attenuation
FIX: Still bug in propogation by light enclousure
LIGHTING - DYNAMIC
TODO: Add lighting manager for dynamic lights, so the closest X lights can be retrived

VERTEXINDEXMANAGER
FIX - MINOR: Oxels appear to not already being removed. I just saw a oxel with no quads in addComponentData

RENDERING
IMPROVE: When adjusting screen size, the dispose/create cycle is called multiple times. Should only re-get context when mouse is released.

////////////////////////////////////////////
COMPLETED
FIX: Dragon: Wings not right after taking off
FIX: Dragon Fire breath uses RED, yuck! Change to Lava or Fire
FIX: Lagging after hitting dragon breath on stone
FIX: Particles should be UNLIT, not lights
TODO: I notice a large frame rate hit the frame after I redraw a bunch of oxels, what give?
TYPEINFO: Add an fullbright flag to types.
FIX: Lights not spreading correctly
DONE: Lights below 1 meter dont work correctly
DONE: Arm on left with torch is annoying - clear view
DONE: Head voxel are annoying - clear view
DONE: Torch on and off!

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Goal: to become a profitable game studio in 1 year
SWOT:
Strengths:
14 years of experience designing and leading virtual worlds projects, leading successful software projects for 25 years.
Product in alpha stage so dev risk is lower
located in lower cost and area with tax breaks for game dev
licenseing opportunities
Designed from start to be mobile ready
Emerging market space.
Data driven design
Browser based
International market possibilities
Encourages user driven content

Weaknesses:
Single person studio
No connections to online publications
limited testing at scale
some dependancy on online service providers (player.io aka yahoo game network)

Opportunities
Minecraft exposed a 250 million opportunity which could be a billion dollar opportunity
steam punk space under targeted.

Threats
Adobe Flash is 5-10 years from end of lifecycle
While other next generation voxel engines exist. None are targeted toward this space currently.
