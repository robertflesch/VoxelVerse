	/**
	 * The TaskGroup is a data structure that allows a set of tasks
	 * to be grouped together as a set.  The TaskGroup can then be
	 * added to the TaskController and all of the grouped task will
	 * be exectued first before the next task in the controller is
	 * processed.
	 * 
	 * <p>When an override is provided to the task controller, the
	 * task group acts as a parent type and the task group will
	 * remove all tasks if the provided override matches the group
	 * type.  The individual type of the task is ignored in this
	 * case.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Tasks added to the group can override the same was as if they were
	 * added directly to the TaskController. Upon adding a task, the TaskGroup
	 * will evaluate the tasks overrides and the tasks selfOverrding boolean 
	 * and will take appropriate action.  The functionality is similar to the
	 * TaskController's override mechinism.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>TaskGroups can NOT be added to other TaskGroups at this time. A generic error will
	 * be thrown if this occurs</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Note: Once a TaskGroup has been added to the TaskController and queued, 
	 * the TaskGroup will no longer accept additional Task and will throw a generic error.
